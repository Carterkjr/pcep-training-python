# PCEP Training Lesson Plan

This folder contains the lesson plan used as a reference for my Python Institute PCEP certification preparation.

The lesson plan was AI-assisted (Claude AI) and is used strictly as a structured study guide.
All Python code, logic, and exercises in this repository were written, tested, and reviewed manually as part of active learning.
