# Day 3–4: Data Types

This folder contains my completed work for **Day 3–4 of Week 2** in my PCEP training plan.

The focus of this section is understanding Python’s core built-in data types, how values are classified, and how to avoid common beginner mistakes when working with data.

---

## Topics Covered

- Python’s four basic data types:
  - int
  - float
  - str
  - bool
- Identifying data types using `type()`
- Choosing appropriate data types for different scenarios
- Common beginner mistakes related to data types

---
