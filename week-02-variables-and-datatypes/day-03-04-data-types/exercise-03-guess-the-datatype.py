# Week 2 - Variables and Data Types

# Lesson: Day 3-4: Practice Excerises

# ******************************************************

# Exercise 3: Guess the Type - Before running this code, try to guess what type each variable will be:

# Guess the types before running! - # I put Comments next to var as my guess before running the code
var1 = 100           # This is a Integer (int) type
var2 = 100.0         # This is a Float (float) type
var3 = "100"         # This is a String (str) tpye - the value wrapped in qrotes makes this a TEXT data type, which makes it a string
var4 = False         # This is a Boolean (bool) type - Bools are True/False. Think of Boolean as Yes/No or On/Off
var5 = 0             # This is a Integer (int) type
var6 = 0.0           # This is a Float (float) type
var7 = "True"        # NICE TRY!!! Lol - Even though this says True, which LOOKS like a Boolean, it's wrapped in quotes, so it's String (str) type! 
var8 = ""            # Even though the variable is empty, it's still wrapped in quotes. So it's also a String (str). It's just an empty string

# Check your guesses
print("var1 =", var1, "- Type:", type(var1))
print("var2 =", var2, "- Type:", type(var2))
print("var3 =", var3, "- Type:", type(var3))
print("var4 =", var4, "- Type:", type(var4))
print("var5 =", var5, "- Type:", type(var5))
print("var6 =", var6, "- Type:", type(var6))
print("var7 =", var7, "- Type:", type(var7))
print("var8 =", var8, "- Type:", type(var8))
print()
