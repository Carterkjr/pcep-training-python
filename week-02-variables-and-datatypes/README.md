# Week 2 – Variables and Data Types

This folder contains my completed work for **Week 2** of my PCEP (Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer) training plan.

Week 2 focuses on understanding how Python stores, represents, and manipulates data through variables and data types. The exercises and examples build on Week 1 fundamentals and introduce concepts that are critical for writing meaningful Python programs.

---

## Topics Covered

- Creating and assigning variables
- Reassigning variable values
- Python built-in data types
  - int
  - float
  - str
  - bool
- Type checking using `type()`
- Type conversion (casting)
- Using variables and data types in practical scenarios
- Reviewing and validating understanding through recap and challenge exercises

---

Covers the fundamentals of creating, assigning, and updating variables.

Includes:
- Lesson examples
- Multiple small practice exercises applying variable assignment in real-world-style scenarios

---

### Day 3–4: Data Types
Introduces Python’s core built-in data types and how values are classified and handled.

Includes:
- Data type examples
- Exercises focused on identifying and working with different data types

---

### Day 5–6: Type Conversion
Focuses on converting between data types and understanding how Python handles user input and casting.

Includes:
- Type conversion examples
- Exercises involving casting and basic input handling

---

### Day 7: Recap and Review
Consolidates all Week 2 concepts.

Includes:
- Recap of variables and data types
- Self-assessment and reflection on readiness to move forward

---

### Week 2 Final Challenge
A cumulative challenge that applies:
- Variable assignment
- Data types
- Type conversion
- Logical thinking

This challenge serves as a checkpoint before moving into more advanced topics such as operators and expressions.

## Learning Outcome

By the end of Week 2, I was able to:
- Confidently create and manage variables
- Identify and use Python’s core data types
- Convert between data types when needed
- Apply variables and data types in practical coding exercises

These skills form a critical foundation for upcoming topics, including operators, expressions, and conditional logic.
