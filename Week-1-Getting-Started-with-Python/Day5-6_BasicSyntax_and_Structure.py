# Lesson: Day 5-6: Basic Syntax and Structure

# ******************************************************

"""
Key Python syntax rules:

    Indentation matters! Python uses indentation instead of braces {}
    Case sensitive: "Print" is different from "print"
    No semicolons needed at end of lines
    Comments start with #
"""

# Pracice for today:

# This is a comment
print("Python uses indentation")
print("Each line at the same level")
    # This would cause an IndentationError if not in a block

# Multiple print statements
print("Line 1")
print("Line 2")
print("Line 3")
