# Lesson: Day 3-4: Python Interpreter vs Scripts

# ******************************************************

"""
Understanding two ways to run Python:

Interactive Mode (Python Interpreter):
    •Type python in command prompt
    •You'll see >>> prompt
    •Type code line by line, see results immediately
    •Great for testing small pieces of code
    
Script Mode:
    •Write code in a .py file
    •Run with python filename.py
    •Better for complete programs
    
Try this today:
1.Open Python interpreter and type (then pres ENTER):

    print("Hello, World!")
    5 + 3
    "Python" + " is awesome!"

2. Create a file called hello.py with:

    print("Hello from a Python script!")
    print("This is my first program")

3.Run it: python hello.py
