If you want more practice this week:

1. Personal Info Program: Create a script that displays your name, age, city, and future programming goals
2. Simple ASCII Art: Use print statements to create simple text art:

python
print("  /\\_/\\  ")
print(" ( o.o ) ")
print("  > ^ <  ")

3. Math Explorer: Write a program that shows different math operations and their results
4. Comment Challenge: Take any code you've written and add detailed comments explaining what each line does
