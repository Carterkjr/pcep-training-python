# PCEP Training – Python

This repository documents my structured preparation for the **Python Institute PCEP (Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer)** certification.

It is organized week by week and includes Python practice scripts, pseudocode, and notes that demonstrate my learning progress and understanding of core Python concepts such as variables, control flow, logical operators, comparisons, and basic program structure.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves two primary goals:

1. **PCEP Certification Preparation**  
   - Practice exercises aligned with a structured lesson plan  
   - Focus on Python fundamentals and exam-relevant logic  
   - Emphasis on readability, correctness, and operator precedence  

2. **Version Control & GitHub Skill Development**  
   - Reinforce hands-on GitHub usage following my first team-based Software Engineering project (ECS)  
   - Practice organizing projects, writing documentation, and managing incremental progress  
   - Apply real-world repository structure to learning-focused code

## Learning Approach

Each week typically follows a simple development workflow:

1. **Requirements / Problem Description**
2. **Pseudocode or Logical Breakdown**
3. **Python Implementation**
4. **Review and Refactoring (when applicable)**

This mirrors the way small development tasks are commonly approached in team and professional environments.

## AI-Assisted Learning Disclosure

The lesson plan used for this training was **AI-assisted**, generated with support from Claude AI, and used as a structured study guide.

All code, logic, and implementations in this repository were:
- Written and reviewed manually
- Executed and tested locally
- Used as part of active learning and exam preparation

AI is used here as a **learning aid**, not a substitute for understanding or implementation.
